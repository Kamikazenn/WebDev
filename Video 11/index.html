            What are Semantic Tags?
        </h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                Semantic tags are HTML tags that have a specific meaning. They describe the content and the role of the elements they contain. For example, the header tag is a semantic tag that represents the header of a web page or a section. The article tag is another semantic tag that represents a self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post or a news article. Semantic tags are important because they help to make your HTML code more readable and understandable for both humans and machines. They also improve the accessibility, SEO, and compatibility of your web pages.
